# Carbon Emissions Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between various lifestyle factors and carbon emissions. The dataset, **Carbon Emission.csv**, contains attributes such as diet, transportation methods, heating energy source, and more. By leveraging Python and libraries like pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can help individuals make more environmentally-friendly lifestyle choices.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for effective analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between lifestyle factors and carbon emissions.
- **Visualization**: Using Python libraries to visualize complex relationships and distributions.
- **Actionable Insights**: Generating insights that can help reduce individual carbon footprints.

## Dataset

The **Carbon Emission.csv** dataset includes the following columns:

- **Body Type**: Body type of the individual (e.g., overweight, obese, etc.)
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female)
- **Diet**: Type of diet (e.g., omnivore, vegetarian, vegan)
- **How Often Shower**: Frequency of showering
- **Heating Energy Source**: Type of heating energy used (coal, natural gas, etc.)
- **Transport**: Mode of transportation (e.g., public, private)
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicle used (e.g., petrol, diesel, hybrid)
- **Social Activity**: Frequency of social activity (often, sometimes, never)
- **Monthly Grocery Bill**: Monthly expenditure on groceries
- **Frequency of Traveling by Air**: How often the individual travels by air
- **Vehicle Monthly Distance Km**: Distance traveled by vehicle monthly
- **Waste Bag Size**: Size of waste bags used by the individual
- **Waste Bag Weekly Count**: Number of waste bags used per week
- **How Long TV/PC Daily Hour**: Hours spent on TV or PC daily
- **How Many New Clothes Monthly**: Number of new clothes bought monthly
- **How Long Internet Daily Hour**: Hours spent on the internet daily
- **Energy Efficiency**: Whether the individual practices energy efficiency (Yes/No/Sometimes)
- **Recycling**: Types of materials recycled (e.g., paper, plastic)
- **Cooking With**: Cooking methods used (e.g., stove, oven)
- **Carbon Emission**: Total carbon emission (dependent variable)

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned by removing missing values and converting categorical variables to appropriate types for analysis. This ensures the dataset is ready for analysis and avoids issues caused by inconsistencies in the data.
  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Various statistical methods were applied, including grouping the data by lifestyle factors (such as diet, air travel frequency, heating energy source) and calculating the mean or distribution of carbon emissions for each group. This helped identify potential correlations and patterns.
  
- **Visualization**: Plots were generated using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries to visualize the distribution of carbon emissions and to showcase the relationships between lifestyle factors and carbon emissions. This step provided clear visual insights into the data.
  
- **Modeling (Optional)**: Predictive models could be implemented to estimate carbon emissions based on lifestyle attributes. While this was not implemented in this project, such models could potentially improve understanding and forecasting of individual carbon footprints.

## Tools

This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for working with structured data.
- **Numpy**: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and helps in numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is used for statistical data visualization and makes it easier to create informative and attractive plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.

### Data Distribution
A histogram and KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plot to visualize the distribution of **Carbon Emission** values.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8,3))
sns.histplot(df['CarbonEmission'], bins=10, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Carbon Emissions')
plt.xlabel('Carbon Emission')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
